            <p>
                Born on July 23, 1958, in Killeen, Texas, Jim was the son of Charles Lee Gaskin and Harriet Loraine
                Turman
                Gaskin. He had two brothers and three sisters in total and learned from an early age the dignity of
                labor —
                qualities of character which Jim endeavored to instill in his own children.

            </p>
            <p>
                In 1977, Jim married his one true love, Lynita Jean Ulmer, and they settled in West Point, Mississippi,
                where
                they were members of West End Baptist Church. Very active in the church Jim taught Sunday school and
                served
                as a
                deacon for many years.
            </p>

            <p>
                Jim’s early working years were with West Point Casket Company where he served for more than 16 years. In
                West
                Point he also began his career in the grocery produce business, working for Bryan Foods and Sunflower.
                After
                moving to Pearl Jim worked for Sharon’s Produce and Save A Lot Supermarket, and at the time of his
                passing
                was
                employed as produce manager for Corner Market.

            </p>
            <p>
                Jim’s walk with Christ was foremost in his life, and he strived to be the best Christian husband and
                father
                possible. After moving to Pearl he became a faithful member of The Exchange Church in Pearl.

            </p>
            <p>
                Other than Jesus Christ his family was his greatest passion, and Jim was truly happiest when with his
                wife,
                children, and precious grandchildren. In his free time Jim enjoyed traveling, especially to the Smoky
                Mountains,
                and he was an avid fisherman.
            </p>

            <p>
                Jim was preceded in death by his father and step-mother, Charles and Inge Gaskin; mother, Harriet
                Loraine
                Turman
                Gaskin; step-father, James Saylors; brother, Charles L. “Chuck” Gaskin, Jr.; and sister, Lora Galvin.

            </p>
            <p>
                He is survived by his beloved wife of 45 years, Jean Gaskin; son, Chris Gaskin and wife Heather;
                daughters,
                Cindy Sessions and husband Roddy, and Mary Phariss and husband Shane; brother, James Saylors, Jr. and
                wife
                Angie; sisters, Angelica Smith and husband Robert, and Manuela Melton and husband David; and
                grandchildren,
                Hannah Grace Gaskin, Sarah Gaskin, Paisley Sessions, Bella Sessions, Philip Phariss, Raelyn Phariss,
                Spencer
                Phariss, and Dawson Phariss.
